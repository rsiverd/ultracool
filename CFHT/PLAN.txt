# Thoughts for the CFHT data processing (images to source RA/DE) pipeline

WIRCam is removed and reinstalled frequently on the telescope. It would
be helpful to know what the mechanical and optical tolerances are on
this procedure. Specifically, how much can the camera sensors ultimately
shift and rotate within the focal plane?
It may not be reasonable to expect a single distortion solution for the
entire data set. Any distortion components that arise within the WIRCam
itself would likely stay constant (provided no disassembly etc). But
distortion in the focal plane itself due to telescope optics may shift
relative to the detector pixels. In that case, would we separate 
distortion components from the telescope and detector?  

Things to learn:
* is there CAD?
* can I get a hold of laboratory measurements or raytraces that
   might inform our choice of projection?
