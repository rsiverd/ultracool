Part of the idea of the ExtendedCatalog format was extensibility. I have
been dumping lots of extra columns into the individual tables to simplify
the downstream joining process. What I realized today was that there is
an implicit requirement that all of the columns actually match across
catalogs in order for the joint solution to work. 

This is a problem if I want to add lots of extra colums for one instrument 
and not another. It also presents the issue that new column additions that
prove necessary with a new data set would effectively invalidate data sets
already on disk that I previously extracted. Not good!

I think this means that the joint fitting system needs to more explicitly
handle the issue of instrument-specific data tables. One way to handle this:
* allow AstFit() to accept multiple data sets
* require that those multiple data sets have required columns that DO match
* for fitting purposes, create a single joint array that consists of only
      the columns needed to execute fitting
* maintain indexes into the original data sets to track data point origin
      and to allow data set augmentation (residuals, etc.)

I need to think carefully about whether the ExtCat should have standardized
RA/Dec X/Y keywords.

OH NO!  For the purposes of the tangent projection, we want dewarped X,Y
coordinates relative to CRPIXn. But other applications, such as the analysis
of subpixel inhomogeneity, really do want the detection coordinates. 
Questions:
* Should the dewarped X,Y even be part of the ExtCat since they can be 
   calculated on-the-fly?
* What do we do in the case of high-accuracy WCS that includes distortion
   terms? Should those intermediate coordinates get included in the ExtCat?

The GaiaMatch() class should do a two-way matching to eliminate duplicates.
This necessarily needs to occur as part of a batch comparison.
