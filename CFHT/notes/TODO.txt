# Things to do that are specific to CFHT/WIRCam
* decide on file naming convention, implement wircam_parse.py
* adjust CFHT downloader so that early images get zero-padded name
* Python-based renaming script that handles downloads, splits by runid
* implement image preprocessor. Need to check for major image problems
      like bad amplifiers, improper flat-fielding, etc.
* remove the UNDEFINED line from headers? Could be done by linker, otherwise
      in image preprocessing

* Gaia ID for matched objects should go into the ExtCat tables

* folder name should go into the ExtCat tables (group identifier)
   --> Spitzer ExtCats should get the AOR

* per-runid joint solution, enables pruning of bad sources

* generalized source list generator, need to sort out the grouping problem
