# Things to do that are specific to CFHT/WIRCam
* decide on file naming convention, implement wircam_parse.py
* adjust CFHT downloader so that early images get zero-padded name
* Python-based renaming script that handles downloads, splits by runid
* implement image preprocessor. Need to check for major image problems
      like bad amplifiers, improper flat-fielding, etc.
* remove the UNDEFINED line from headers? Could be done by linker, otherwise
      in image preprocessing

* Gaia ID for matched objects should go into the ExtCat tables
