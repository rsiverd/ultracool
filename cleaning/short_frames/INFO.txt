Many Spitzer observations begin with a short, throwaway exposure for
instrumental reasons. These frames should not be used for science and
ought to be quarantined from the get-go for simplicity.

Commands below may were used to investigate the nature of the beast.
./01_collect_files_headers.sh    --> lists CBCD files and select headers
./03_inspect_metadata.py         --> interactive python commands


Findings:
* in all cases seen so far, short frames appear to be part of HDR imaging
* short frames can be identified by the presence of the PTGCPD keyword,
      which indicates the pointing information was copied from a 'long'
      frame obtained at the same location
* skipping images with PTGCPD in the header during preprocessing is a quick
      and easy way to remove these images from workflow without requiring
      adjustments to download scripts or more complicated analysis
* it may be useful to incorporate short frame information (in theory this
      ought to help ...) at a future time
