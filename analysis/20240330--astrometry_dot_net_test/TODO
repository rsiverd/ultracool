* pipeline version  **CHANGED, but not corresponding to issues**
* more H2 images?  **NO**
* FWHM per runid
* Gaia epoch???
* wide dither steps?
* bright pixel artifacts?
* compare residuals to CD matrix values. are the latter runids just rotated?
* weighted fit?
* refraction first
* gaia dr3

updated runid_residuals:
* N_images, dets / img

* add binning to 25_tfa_noisemod plot
* visual inspection of joint fit positions/matches. are we good?
   --> in particular, is there evidence that the FOV center is wrong?

* inliers-only TFA noise model ...

* Relative refraction at the extraction stage
* SolSys ephemeris at the extraction stage
* RMS model, per-filter

* Nail down (finally) whether RUNID or QRUNID divides camera orientation

* QSOGRADE filtering after download
* incorporate GAIN into the extraction process (note GAINERR and GAINMEAS)
* ensure 'signal' (flux * exptime =~ counts) is included at extraction time
* decide FWHM measure, incorporate into extraction and use for noise model
* decide what to call "signal" and make sure it is included at extraction stage
* implement AstFit pruning based on high rweight when selecting output data?
      --> alternatively, update inliers?
      --> NOTE 1: this is already included in the _use_XX_err array
