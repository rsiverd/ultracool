* pipeline version  **CHANGED, but not corresponding to issues**
* more H2 images?  **NO**
* FWHM per runid
* Gaia epoch???
* wide dither steps?
* bright pixel artifacts?
* compare residuals to CD matrix values. are the latter runids just rotated?
* weighted fit?
* refraction first
* gaia dr3

updated runid_residuals:
* N_images, dets / img


* Relative refraction at the extraction stage
* SolSys ephemeris at the extraction stage
* RMS model, per-filter

* Nail down (finally) whether RUNID or QRUNID divides camera orientation
