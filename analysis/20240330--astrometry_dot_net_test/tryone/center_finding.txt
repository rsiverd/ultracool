Fit relative rotations of the four sensors? Once I have a good global fit,
evaluate whether or not the four sensors are rotated w.r.t. one another.


Allow the CRPIX center to be somewhere in the 'gutters' of the mosaic, or at
least adopt that as a starting point. Use gutters of 45 arcsec (150 pix).

Nominal center from WIRCam header is:
2122.69077900 -81.6788876100

Useful numbers:
2048 + 74 = 2122

Initial center guess should be:
(NE) 2122,  -74
(NW)  -74,  -74
(SE) 2122, 2122
(SW)  -74, 2122

Select stars within 1000 pix of the trial center initially. If distortion
is radial, we don't care about relative rotations.

Iterate to solution by:
a) Evaluate angular separation of Gaia matches from assumed CRVAL,
b) Evaluate radial separation of sources from the assumed CRPIX
