I want to keep an example of the results I get from vizquery when scanning
for WIRCam images from the CADC. I hacked fetch_CFHT_data.py to save a
result set as a pickle object for further inspection. This could be done
again in the future by uncommenting the appropriate lines (near line 400)
and running again. 

The stored result is:
> cadc_hits.pickle

File 01_load_hits.py can be used to recover data into ipython.


import astropy.table as apt  # just in case
import pickle
save_hits = 'cadc_hits.pickle'

with open(save_hits, 'rb') as chp:
    hits = pickle.load(chp)
