A significant 'constellation' of fairly bright residual spots is observed in
the ch1 data from AOR 17577216. See this folder:
/net/hbfhpc1/bigraid/rsiverd/ucd_targets/2m0415/r17577216

The residual data visibly fades with time. Unfortunately, it also apparently
causes a strong false positive in the cross-correlation routine used for
stacking data for at least one image. In this analysis, I'm looking into the
origin of the 'ghost' and whether or not it is feasible to correct. 

Because the data are dithered, the approximate residual can be semi-cleanly
separated by simple median combination of raw data. However, this pattern
would need to be scaled for each frame to account for the visible weakening
of the pattern as time passes.

I suspect the issue is caused by a very bright star off-frame. If true, the
dither pattern of individual images should mimic the residual seen on the
individual images.
