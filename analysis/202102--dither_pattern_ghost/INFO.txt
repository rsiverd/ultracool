A significant 'constellation' of fairly bright residual spots is observed in
the ch1 data from AOR 17577216. See this folder:
/net/hbfhpc1/bigraid/rsiverd/ucd_targets/2m0415/r17577216

The residual data visibly fades with time. Unfortunately, it also apparently
causes a strong false positive in the cross-correlation routine used for
stacking data for at least one image. In this analysis, I'm looking into the
origin of the 'ghost' and whether or not it is feasible to correct. 

Because the data are dithered, the approximate residual can be semi-cleanly
separated by simple median combination of raw data. However, this pattern
would need to be scaled for each frame to account for the visible weakening
of the pattern as time passes.

I suspect the issue is caused by a very bright star off-frame. If true, the
dither pattern of individual images should mimic the residual seen on the
individual images.


RESULT:

The cause of the ghost/residual appears to indeed be a bright star on the
not-in-use sensor during the first half of the AOR. Considerations:
* The affected images were taken in ch1
* Data in ch2 were obtained first, ch1 immediately after.
* ch1 data simultaneous with the ch2 data were not obtained (sadly)
* the ghost pattern seen in the ch1 data exactly matches the ch2 (and ch1)
      dither pattern.
* Data from the previous AOR were obtained but appeared irrelevant.
* Further supporting this belief is the visible diminution of the brightest
      (and latest) portion of the ghost frame relative to the other points
      across the first few ch1 frames.
* To be clear, the individual residual 'stars' have a fixed positional
      pattern but the relative brightness of the individual points varies
      with time. This would be expected for a non-linear diminution of
      residual brightness with time.
