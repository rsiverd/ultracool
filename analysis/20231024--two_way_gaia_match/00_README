The "dumb" Gaia matching provided in gaia_match.py can be made more robust
and useful with a two-way matching process:
* attempt to match all detections to Gaia (may produce duplicates)
* collect and deduplicate Gaia matches into "useful" subset
* match each "useful" Gaia match against its nearest detection
* keep the results of the second pass

This procedure ensures that no Gaia star is matched more than once. These
spurious matches seem to interfere with astrometric parameter fitting in
unpredictable ways.

This investigation aims to flesh out an efficient way of performing the
two-way match. I want to test a few different methods using pandas built-ins
that may be very fast. Performance is a concern because I use this matching
tool as part of the WCS parameter fine-tuning for CFHT / WIRCam processing.


Other softwares:
* GeoPandas exists and can perform spatial joins
* astropy has some kind of 2-D matching routine too
