How to iteratively improve PA, CRVAL1, CRVAL2 using sources in the lower-right
corner of the WIRCam detector (near the focal plane center). Working with
sources near the focal plane center (CRPIX1, CRPIX2) minimizes the effect of
incorrect/unknown detector position angle on the sky.

1. Coarse match to Gaia with a fairly large tolerance.
2. Calculate RA/DE offsets, apply to the CRVAL1 and CRVAL2.
3. Perform grid search for improved CRVAL1 and CRVAL2 relative to the offset
position obtained in step (2). This process uses the number of matches as its
primary figure of merit with match distances as a secondary consideration in
case of ties. This is quite reliable as long as the grid spans the answer!
4. Once the grid cell is known, calculate and apply RA/DE offsets again. This
produces a pretty good CRVAL1, CRVAL2 pair.
5. Re-detect Gaia matches with updated coordinates
5. Iterate over:
   --> compute PA rotation from segments, update PA
   --> recompute detection RA/DE values
   --> compute median RA/DE offsets, update CRVAL1 and CRVAL2
