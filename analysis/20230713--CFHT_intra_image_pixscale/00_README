This is a quick investigation into how well we can estimate pixel
scale changes across an image directly from the X,Y pixel separations
and the matched Gaia RA, Dec positions. The data set likely has some
contamination, but the basic idea should still work.

NOTE (2025-01-15): I noticed today that the matches in Abby's giant
CSV files are not unique. This is going to add noise but the basic
idea is probably OK. This test should be repeated without dupes
using newer cross-match routines.
