It turns out that the saturation threshold used in the CFHT pipeline
is not the number that we see in the FITS header. This investigation
aims to figure out where the cutoff is by comparing raw and processed
images.

Result: it looks like there isn't a simple cutoff value for zeroing out
pixels. It may be that data *near* saturated pixels are treated as dubious
at a lower value, something like 40-45k. Some pixels are given the 65535
value that are not that high in the raw images.

A sensible solution is probably to:
(a) treat saturated pixels as I do now with a fixed cutoff
(b) lower that cutoff to something more like 60k (from 65534)
(c) additionally flat as saturated any pixels >40k that are 0 in processed
