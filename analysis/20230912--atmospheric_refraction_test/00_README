I have a formula from Kovalevsky and Seidelmann to use for atmospheric
refraction. This formula depends on local conditions at the observatory.
Here I investigate what weather/conditions data is available in the CFHT
image headers that could be used for this application. I also develop a
working version of the code in Python.


After manual inspection of headers, the following quantities appear to
be present throughout the calib1 data set:
TEMPERAT --> weather tower air temperature [deg C]
RELHUMID --> weather tower relative humidity [%]
PRESSURE --> control room barometric pressure [mbar] 

FINDINGS:
The keywords noted above are populated with sensible values for the
entire data set. This seems like a good starting point.
