I want to know whether or not the WIRCam distortion solution is really
changing from run to run. To that end, I have performed two rounds of
distortion polynomial fitting (fit, reject outliers, refit) for each
run using the Gaia matches from earlier fitting. The two rounds of
distortion polynomial fitting are performed by the current version of:
18_runid_joint_fit.py

This script produces "run_coeffs_1.csv" and "run_coeffs_2.csv" files in
each runid folder. In this investigation, I plan to load and evaluate
those coefficients to compare distortion solutions from run to run.
Comparison of the evaluated data are necessary because of the highly
correlated nature of the coefficients in a polynomial fit.

In addition to the fit coefficients, I have also saved the subsets of
pruned Gaia matches for further analysis and fit RMS evaluation. This
content is stored in the run_match_subset.csv files in the same runid 
folders noted above.
