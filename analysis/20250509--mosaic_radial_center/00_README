Using:
* the linear transformations now known to connect sensor coordinates
* the measured gutter size between sensors
we want to fit for the center of the distortion field (CRPIX1/2) assuming
the distortion is purely radial. Repeat this for multiple QRUNIDs to prove
that CRPIX moves around and set aside the known values for future use.

Steps needed to make this work:
1) Select high-quality image for analysis.
2) Get astrometry.net solution for each sensor, ensure it is decent
3) Perform Gaia match using ast.net solution as a guide
4) Measure radial displacement of sources from test centers.
5) Move the test center around to see if we can localize it.

Development tasks:
1) Need a four-sensor ast.net solution fetcher
