Using:
* the linear transformations now known to connect sensor coordinates
* the measured gutter size between sensors
we want to fit for the center of the distortion field (CRPIX1/2) assuming
the distortion is purely radial. Repeat this for multiple QRUNIDs to prove
that CRPIX moves around and set aside the known values for future use.
