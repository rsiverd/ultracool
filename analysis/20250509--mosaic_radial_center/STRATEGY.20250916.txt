# The distortion correction can be computed in two "directions" depending
# on implementation. We want something that can be applied to detections
# in practice before computing RA/DE coordinates. However, the distortion
# is not necessarily guaranteed to be radial in that reference frame if it
# comes from the telescope mirror (it would be symmetric in focal plane
# coordinates presumably).


# Error evaluator (TRY TWO WAYS):
Loop over quadrants. Within each quadrant,
   * collect CD matrix and CRVAL items
   * calculate test_focal_xrel, test_focal_yrel from inverse_tan_cdmcrv using
         gstars. This is where stars would be in a fair, flat focal plane.
   # CCD2FOC method:
      * compute CCD xrel,yrel coordinates from Gaia gxx, gyy
      * apply ccd2foc distortion correction (pushes stars 'away' from CRPIX)
      * compare adj_gxx, adj_gyy to test_focal_xrel, test_focal_yrel
   # FOC2CCD method:
      * apply foc2ccd distortion correction to test_focal_xrel, test_focal_yrel
            (pushes stars 'towards' CRPIX)
      * compare adj_focal_xrel,adj_focal_yrel to gxx,gyy
   #### Normalize residuals such that sum(res**2) == 1.0
   # Normalize squared residuals by number of stars in quadrant
