This analysis needs to be expanded from this single fiducial image to include
multiple images. I want to start with several from the same RUNID (11BQ02).
If we are correct that hardware is steady throughout the RUNID, most of the
WCS parameters should be common to all the images in the folder.

Once that is shown to work, data from a separate RUNID can also be included.
The goal is to verify that some of the instrumental parameters truly are
constant, that the model I use separates the constant params from the variable
params sufficiently well, and that I can use the well-known parameters to get
a decent coordinate solution without astrometry.net (IMPORTANT!). 

This side-investigation aims to get an acceptable fit from the rapidly-produced
'fcat' catalogs I have been making previously. This will demonstrate that the
SEP values are good enough to use and that a good guess for the distortion
is good enough to jump start the star matching.

NOTE: this work is primarily for proof-of-concept. Four-sensor processing
probably warrants a significant rethink of the pipeline.

Steps to execute:
# 1) Set up environment:
source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate; conda activate astrom
cd /home/rsiverd/ucd_project/ultracool
source ENVIRONMENT.sh
cd -

# 2) Make lists of folders that can be scanned to make fcat listings.
./02_list_fcat_dirs.sh imdirs_c1 --START

# 3) Build a list of available images. Associate full paths to catalogs from
# all four sensors with each base name.
./03_list_fcat_files.sh imdirs_11BQ02.txt
./03_list_fcat_files.sh imdirs_11.txt

# 4) Run the script:
#./11_test_fit_4pack.py -L fcat_paths.csv -I wircam_H2_1325861p
./11_test_fit_4pack.py -L fcat_paths.csv -I wircam_J_1325839p
./11_test_fit_4pack.py -L fcat_paths.csv -I wircam_J_1325850p
