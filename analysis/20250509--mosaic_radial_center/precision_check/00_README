This side investigation aims to empirically evaluate the astrometric 
uncertainty as a function of object brightness (i.e., make RMS plots).
Among other things, I hope to assess whether the four sensors need
individualized noise models or if I can get away with a single model
for all WIRCam images and sensors.

# Snag data at outset of investigation:
cp ../best_fit_diags.csv .

Data in the above CSV file include Gaia IDs and sky coordinates,
pixel positions, fluxes, and FWHMs from SExtractor, plus other
derived quantities.
