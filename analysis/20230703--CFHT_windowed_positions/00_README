This is a quick illustration of the difference between windowed
and unwindowed position measurements using whatever smoothing
window I had by default (probably not ideal). 

The distribution of differences is very similar in X and Y (good).
Values we see are effectively:
* -0.1 ~ 25th percentile
*  0.0 ~ median
* +0.1 ~ 75th percentile

The IQR scaled to normal is ~0.073 in X and ~0.075 in Y.
