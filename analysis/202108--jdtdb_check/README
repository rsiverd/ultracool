After some old fashioned visual inspection, it looks like timestamps may have
been scrambled in the Spitzer data sets (for the targets in particular). The
scripts in this folder are intended to retrieve header information from images
that have been analyzed to provide 'ground truth' against which the train wreck
of my analysis code can be compared.

The trouble with JDTDB was tracked down to an issue with HORIZONS ephemeris
retrieval. HORIZONS results are always sorted by time, even if the input epoch
list is not. The not-zero-padded AOR in SST filenames led to a circumstance
where requests included out-of-order timestamps. This caused the ephemeris
tables to have incorrect timestamps. The issue has been fixed and a halting
check has been added to ephemeris retrieval code to prevent this from happening
in the future.
