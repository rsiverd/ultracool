By plotting the raw X,Y positions of detections across the entire 10-year
data set, we can see a few things:

1) The dither pattern used for collecting observations. This may not be
visible in individual cells, but would be seen in an autocorrelation of
X, Y position measurements.

2) Evidence for instrument rotation changes. Individual sources form loci
of points that spread out along ~linear tracks. These tracks run ~perpendicular
to the direction to the focal plane center, indicating rotation.
