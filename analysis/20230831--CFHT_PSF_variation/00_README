While looking into potential causes of the high residuals seen in some
specific CFHT runs, I noted that there can be significant differences
in the PSF between runs. The difference in appearance looks to be
optical in nature (perhaps due to varying mechanical stresses?) and
not due to anything atmospheric.

Specific variations:
* the vertical PSF elongation seen in the upper-left corner of the NE
      sensor is not present in some runs.
* runs that do not exhibit that vertical elongation seem to have a
      horizontal elongation near the lower edge of the NE sensor
