* Add spacecraft orientation (X-position) specifically as a trend.

* Check field star astrometric parameters against Gaia for accuracy
--> (my_param - gaia_param) / my_error =~ Gaussian variance 1

* Check whether systematics / noise change with exposure time

* include zenith angle in extended catalog explicitly? Or should this be
      handled earlier in the process?

* Calculate sensible uncertainties and include those in the catalogs from start

* Giant residuals histogram

* Report number of exposures used
* Report number of epochs used

* Compare results obtained to prior work

* Excess astrometric variability plot

* Check histogram of 2m0415 position angles
* Disable intra-pixel TFA term

* ExtendedCatalog object should throw an error when loading a non-catalog from FITS.

* Refit noise model using many objects with lots of epochs
--> Look for targets with the most epochs

* Neighbor stars need to use errors

* Check for fit improvements to CD matrix

* RUWE for targets in pipeline

* Plate Scale vs number of sources in the field

* Plot of (Fitted PA - header PA) to understand provenance and look for outliers

* Add to individual data catalogs:
--> AOR tag ??
--> ngaia = number of gaia stars identified in the image
--> ngaor = number of gaia stars identified in the AOR (joint fit)
