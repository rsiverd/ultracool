* Add spacecraft orientation (X-position) specifically as a trend.

* Check field star astrometric parameters against Gaia for accuracy
--> (my_param - gaia_param) / my_error =~ Gaussian variance 1

* Check whether systematics / noise change with exposure time

* include zenith angle in extended catalog explicitly? Or should this be
      handled earlier in the process?

* Calculate sensible uncertainties and include those in the catalogs from start

* Giant residuals histogram

* Report number of exposures used
* Report number of epochs used

* Compare results obtained to prior work

* Excess astrometric variability plot
